## How is pre-commit's eslint and prettier work?

When git's pre-commit hook run, it calls a rush command-line:

```rush lint-staged```

The definition of this command can be found in `<root>/common/config/rush/comman-line.json`:

```
    {
      "name": "lint-staged",
      "commandKind": "global",
      "summary": "Used by the pre-commit Git hook. This command invokes the library called okonet/lint-staged to run eslint on staged changes.",
      "autoinstallerName": "rush-lint",
      "shellCommand": "lint-staged --debug --verbose"
    },
```

So when `rush lint-staged` is called, the above definition invoke the command:

```
<root>/common/autoinstallers/rush-lint/node_module/.bin/lint-staged --debug --verbose
```

The above binary was installed by the npm packaged called `lint-staged` [https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

`lint-staged` is an npm-package installed in `autoinstaller/rush-lint`, it will run when git-cached is not empty.

During the execution, `lint-staged` will search up directory to look for `<monorepo-root>/.lintstagedrc`, whose content are:

```
{
  "{apps,packages,features}/**/*.js?(x)": [
    "eslint --fix --color",
    "prettier --write"
  ],
  "{apps,packages,features}/**/*.ts?(x)": [
    "eslint --fix --color",
    "prettier --parser=typescript --write"
  ],
  "{apps,packages,features}/**/*.*.{css,less,md,json}": [
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```
In the configuration above you can see that it has configured lint-staged to run:

`eslint --fix --color` and `prettier --write` at various path match by the glob.

#### Important question:

Where does lint-staged find the binary for eslint and prettier?

#### Answer:

```
<root>/common/autoinstallers/rush-lint/node_modules/.bin/eslint
<root>/common/autoinstallers/rush-lint/node_modules/.bin/prettier
```

These binaries are installed by the `autoinstaller/rush-lint/package.json`.

When eslint runs, it will look for nearest `.eslintrc.js` (current directory or recursively walk up the parent directory).

I have not investigate how prettier find its configuration, but my guess is it works similar to eslint. Currently there is a `.prettierrc` located in `<root>/`.

It is important to understand that `lint-staged` can only execute binary in `node-modules/.bin/`. In the above `eslint` and `prettier` are automatically added to `node-modules/.bin/` by package manager when installing.
If you have some configarution like the following:

```
{
   ...
   ...
   "{apps,packages,features}/**/*.ts?(x)": [
    "eslint --fix --color",
    "prettier --parser=typescript --write",
    "custom-script-for-lintstaged.sh testing123"
  ],
   ...
   ...
}
```
Where you have to execute some custom script such as `custom-script-for-lintstaged.sh` that is not installed by npm package, you have to add it to `node-modules/.bin/` with `(package.json).scripts.postinstall` script:

```
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node post-install-script.js"
  }
```

This extra installation is required because linstaged can only execute binary in `node-modules/.bin/`.
